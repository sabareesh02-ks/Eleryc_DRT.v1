           HOW TO SHARE WITH COLLEAGUES - COMPLETE GUIDE
================================================================================

Your Eleryc Experiment Viewer can be shared with colleagues in several ways.
Choose the option that works best for your situation.

================================================================================
🌐 OPTION 1: LOCAL NETWORK ACCESS (EASIEST - SAME OFFICE)
================================================================================

Perfect for: Colleagues in the same office/network who want to VIEW only

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
When you run START_AUTOMATED_SERVER.bat, the Flask server is accessible
on your local network. Colleagues can access it from their browsers!

STEPS:
------

1. On YOUR Computer:
   ------------------
   a) Run START_AUTOMATED_SERVER.bat
   
   b) Find your IP address:
      - Open Command Prompt (cmd)
      - Type: ipconfig
      - Look for "IPv4 Address" under your network adapter
      - Example: 192.168.1.100

   c) Share this URL with colleagues:
      http://[YOUR_IP]:5000
      
      Example: http://192.168.1.100:5000

2. On COLLEAGUE's Computer:
   -------------------------
   a) Open browser
   
   b) Go to: http://[YOUR_IP]:5000
      (Replace with your actual IP address)
   
   c) They can now view and compare experiments!

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
✅ Works instantly - no installation needed for colleagues
✅ You must keep your computer ON and server RUNNING
✅ Colleagues can VIEW and COMPARE but changes happen on your computer
✅ Only works on same network (same office/WiFi)
✅ Your computer becomes the "server"

PROS:
- Instant access
- No setup for colleagues
- Real-time data

CONS:
- Your computer must stay on
- Only works on same network
- They can't use it when you're offline


================================================================================
📦 OPTION 2: SHARE COMPLETE FOLDER (BEST FOR COLLABORATION)

================================================================================
📝 DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPTION 1 (MOST COMMON)
================================================================================

STEP-BY-STEP: LOCAL NETWORK SHARING
------------------------------------

On YOUR Computer (Host):
------------------------

1. Find Your IP Address:
   
   Windows:
   --------
   a) Press Windows Key + R
   b) Type: cmd
   c) Press Enter
   d) Type: ipconfig
   e) Find "IPv4 Address" (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
   f) Write it down!

   Alternative (Easier):
   ---------------------
   a) Open Settings → Network & Internet
   b) Click Properties
   c) Look for "IPv4 address"

2. Start Server:
   
   Double-click: START_AUTOMATED_SERVER.bat
   
   Important: Leave terminal window open!

3. Test It Yourself First:
   
   Open browser: http://localhost:5000
   Make sure it works!

4. Share with Colleagues:
   
   Tell them to open: http://[YOUR_IP]:5000
   
   Example: "Open your browser and go to http://192.168.1.100:5000"


On COLLEAGUE's Computer (Client):
----------------------------------

1. Make sure you're on the same network (same WiFi/office network)

2. Open ANY web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

3. Type in address bar: http://[HOST_IP]:5000
   (Replace [HOST_IP] with the IP address your colleague gave you)

4. Press Enter

5. You should see the Eleryc Experiment Viewer!

6. Use it like normal:
   - View individual experiments
   - Compare multiple experiments
   - All features work!


TROUBLESHOOTING OPTION 1:
--------------------------

Problem: "This site can't be reached"
Solution:
• Check host computer's IP address is correct
• Verify both computers are on same network
• Check host computer's firewall:
  - Windows Firewall might block port 5000
  - Allow Python through firewall:
    1. Windows Security → Firewall & network protection
    2. Allow an app through firewall
    3. Find Python → Allow both Private and Public

Problem: "Connection refused"
Solution:
• Make sure START_AUTOMATED_SERVER.bat is running on host
• Check server shows "Server running at: http://localhost:5000"

Problem: Works on host but not for colleagues
Solution:
• Firewall is likely blocking
• Try temporarily disabling firewall to test
• Or add exception for port 5000

================================================================================
🔐 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

DATA SENSITIVITY:
-----------------
• Your CSV files contain experimental data
• Make sure sharing is authorized by your company
• Use "Specific people" in OneDrive for sensitive data
• Don't share publicly unless data is approved for distribution

NETWORK ACCESS:
---------------
• Local network sharing (Option 1) is generally safe within office
• Internet deployment (Option 3) requires proper security:
  - Authentication
  - HTTPS
  - Access controls

BEST PRACTICES:
---------------
✓ Share within company network when possible
✓ Use company-approved sharing methods (OneDrive, SharePoint)
✓ Set appropriate permissions (view vs. edit)
✓ Keep track of who has access
✓ Update shared folder when you add new experiments


================================================================================
📊 KEEPING DATA SYNCED
================================================================================

If colleagues have their own copies (Option 2):

METHOD A: OneDrive Sync (Automatic)
------------------------------------
1. Keep UI folder in OneDrive
2. Share with "Can edit" permission
3. Everyone's copy stays synced automatically
4. Changes sync in real-time

METHOD B: Manual Updates (Periodic)
------------------------------------
1. When you add new experiments:
   - Zip just the new experiment folder
   - Email/share with team
   - They add to their separated_by_current/ folder
   - Refresh browser

METHOD C: Central Source (Read-Only)
-------------------------------------
1. Keep master copy on shared drive
2. Everyone reads from same location
3. Only you can add/modify experiments
4. Everyone sees updates immediately


================================================================================
💡 RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW
================================================================================

FOR SMALL TEAM (2-5 people):
----------------------------
1. Share folder via OneDrive (Option 2)
2. Each person sets up their own copy
3. Keep separated_by_current/ in sync via OneDrive
4. Everyone can compare independently

FOR LARGER TEAM (5+ people):
----------------------------
1. Deploy to company server (Option 3)
2. Everyone accesses same URL
3. Centralized data management
4. You control updates

FOR PRESENTATIONS/DEMOS:
------------------------
1. Use local network sharing (Option 1)
2. Present from your laptop
3. Others can follow along on their devices
4. No setup needed


================================================================================
✅ SUMMARY
================================================================================

EASIEST:     Option 1 - Local Network (for demos, same office)
BEST:        Option 2 - Share Folder (for team collaboration)
ADVANCED:    Option 3 - Cloud Deploy (for company-wide access)
SIMPLEST:    Option 4 - Share PNGs (for reports only)

MY RECOMMENDATION FOR YOU:
--------------------------
Since you're already using OneDrive - eleryc inc:

1. Share the "UI" folder via OneDrive with your team
2. Set permissions to "Can view" or "Can edit"
3. Send them the link with instructions
4. They run FIRST_TIME_SETUP.bat once
5. Everyone can use the system independently!

This gives everyone their own copy while keeping data synced.
