================================================================================
                         ✅ CORS FIX APPLIED!
================================================================================

The "Failed to fetch" error has been fixed!

WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM?
----------------------
The Flask backend wasn't configured to allow Cross-Origin requests (CORS).
When your browser tried to connect to the API, it was blocked for security.

WHAT WAS FIXED?
---------------
✅ Added flask-cors package
✅ Enabled CORS in app.py
✅ Restarted Flask server
✅ Updated requirements.txt
✅ Updated FIRST_TIME_SETUP.bat

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW:
-------------------------

1. Refresh your browser (F5 or Ctrl+F5)
   
2. Try your comparison again:
   ☑️ M7_M7_5psi_07222025 @ 4A
   ☑️ M8_M8_5psi_07232025 @ 4A
   Click "✨ Show Comparison"

3. It should work now! The plots will generate automatically.

================================================================================

SERVER STATUS:
--------------
✅ Flask server is RUNNING on http://localhost:5000
✅ CORS is ENABLED
✅ CSV files for M7 and M8 are VERIFIED to exist

Just refresh your browser and try again!

================================================================================

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------
Before:
• Flask app = Flask(__name__)

After:
• from flask_cors import CORS
• Flask app = Flask(__name__)
• CORS(app)  # Enable CORS for all routes

This allows JavaScript fetch() requests from the browser to successfully
connect to the Flask API endpoint.
